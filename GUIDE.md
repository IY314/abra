# How to use, if you haven't used python from the terminal before

1. Open a terminal app
  - Windows: Command Prompt
  - Mac: Terminal
2. Get into the folder you downloaded (you may have to unzip the file first)
  - cd Downloads/abra
3. Run abra.py
  - Type 'python3 abra.py' and press enter
  - If that doesn't work:
    - Mac: You need to install python 3 from https://python.org
    - Windows: 'python abra.py' will work if 'python --version' prints 3.*something*; otherwise, you need to install python 3
4. Type y or n and press enter to respond to questions
  - once the program knows what words you want to use, it will:
    - copy the definition of each word(you can ctrl/cmd-v without having to ctrl/cmd-c)
    - open 3 tabs in your browser: google synonyms, etymonline.com, google image search for the wor

### Alternative ways that use other apps
